# sql-pizzasales-project-2
Project Description:
This project analyzes a pizza order dataset to derive meaningful insights. By querying different tables and performing various calculations, the project aims to answer key business questions related to customer preferences, sales performance, and pizza category distribution. We use SQL joins, grouping, and aggregating functions to extract valuable information, enabling better decision-making for pizza businesses.

Findings:
Basic Analysis:

Total Number of Orders:
We calculated the total number of orders placed by counting all records in the order table. This metric provides insights into overall demand and sales volume.

Total Revenue from Pizza Sales:
By summing the price of pizzas for each order, we determined the total revenue generated, which helps assess the financial performance of the pizza business.

Highest-Priced Pizza:
After reviewing all pizzas ordered, we identified the highest-priced pizza. This helps to understand which premium pizzas contribute most to revenue.

Most Common Pizza Size Ordered:
We examined the order data and found the most commonly ordered pizza size. This reveals customer preferences and can guide inventory management.

Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types:
By counting the quantities of each pizza type ordered, we identified the top 5 bestsellers. These popular pizzas can be promoted or stocked more frequently.

Intermediate Analysis:

Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered:
Joining relevant tables (orders, pizza categories), we calculated the total quantity ordered for each pizza category (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian). This informs the inventory and supply chain management.

Distribution of Orders by Hour of the Day:
By grouping orders by the hour they were placed, we gained insights into peak order times. This helps in staff planning and setting up delivery strategies.

Category-Wise Distribution of Pizzas:
A more granular look at each pizza category helped determine which category is ordered the most. This helps tailor marketing efforts towards the most popular pizza categories.

Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day:
By grouping orders by date and calculating the daily average, we identified trends in customer ordering behavior, which can inform business strategies for certain days of the week.

Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue:
By calculating the revenue for each pizza type, we identified the top 3 most profitable pizzas, which can guide pricing and promotional strategies.

Advanced Analysis:

Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue:
By calculating the percentage of total revenue contributed by each pizza type, we highlighted the pizzas that are driving most of the sales. This can help with targeted marketing and focus on high-revenue pizzas.

Cumulative Revenue Generated Over Time:
We tracked revenue growth over time to visualize cumulative earnings, which provides insights into business trends and seasonal changes.

Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue for Each Category:
Analyzing revenue by pizza category allowed us to identify the top 3 bestsellers per category. This helps the business optimize its menu for each category's performance.

Conclusion:
This analysis provided valuable insights into pizza sales patterns, customer preferences, and revenue generation. Understanding the most ordered pizza types, peak order times, and the financial impact of each category empowers the pizza business to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies. Additionally, the detailed breakdown by pizza type and time allows for data-driven decisions that enhance overall customer satisfaction and profitability.
